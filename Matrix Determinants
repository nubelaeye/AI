# In this lecture we will study about the Matrix determinants..
# The determinant is special scalar value that we can calculate for any given matrix.
# It maps the square matrix into scalar.
# It enables us to determine whether the matrix can be inverted or not.
# If determine of matrix = 0. then, 
#       * Matrix inversion can't be computed!
#       * Means matrix X is singular: It contains linearly-dependent columns.

# Let's see how we can determine the 2 x 2 matrix...
# for example... x = [a b, c d] -> |x| = a multiply d - b multiply c
# OK, enough talk let's code it..
import numpy as np

x = np.array([[4,2],[-5,-3]])
print(np.linalg.det(x))
