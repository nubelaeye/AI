# In this lecture, we will study about the Data/Image compression..
# As eigenvalues are arranged in descending order in diag( λ ) so too are singular values
# , by convention, arranged in descending order in  D  (or, in this code, diag( σ )). Thus,
# the first left-singular vector of  U  and first right-singular vector of
# V  may represent the most prominent feature of the image:

# Specifically, the image represented as 64 singular vectors 
# is 3.7% of the size of the original!
# Alongside images, we can use singular vectors for dramatic, 
# lossy compression of other types of media files.

# For more you can go through the:- https://github.com/jonkrohn/ML-foundations/blob/master/notebooks/2-linear-algebra-ii.ipynb and go with the Section 3 of SVD compression.
