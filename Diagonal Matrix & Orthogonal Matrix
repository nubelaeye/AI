# In this lecture we will study about the Diagonal matrix and the Orthogonal matrix...
# A diagonal matrix means: That non-zero element along main diagonal and else zero everywhere.
# Identity matrix is example of Diagonal matrix 
# It's computationally efficient : multiplication (X x Y), Inversion -> but can't divide by zero when the main diagonal contains zero..
# Can be non-square but still efficient to use..

# The orthogonal and the orthonormal matrices:
    # Are made up of rows and columns
# This means: A^T x A = A x A^T = Identity matrix
# which also means : A^T = A^-1 x Identity matrix = A ^ -1
# So, A ^ T = A ^ -1
* You have been done with the diagonal and the Orthogoanl matrix....
