# In this lecture we will study about the Trace Operator...
# It is denoted as the Tr(A) and it is just the sum of its diagonal elements of matrix A.
# Okay, let's see how does it work..

import numpy as np

A = np.array([[-1,2],[3,-2],[5,7]])
print(np.trace(A)) # As we studied earlier is the sum of the diagonal-> 25 + 4 = 29.

# The trace operator can be also used for :- Tr(A) = Tr(A^T) and it can also calculate the 
# Forbenius Norm :- By ||A||F = âˆšTr(AAT)
