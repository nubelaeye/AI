# In this lecture we will study about the relationship between determinats and eigenvalues.
# The equation is formed is : Determine(x) = product of all eigenvalue of x.
# OK, then let's see how is this :-
import numpy as np 

x = np.array([[1, 2, 4], [2, -1, 3], [0, 5, 1]])
# calculating the eigenvalue products...
lambdas,V = np.linalg.eig(x)
# Let's check do they have the same value..
print(np.product(lambdas))
print(np.linalg.det(x))

# \det(x)\ quantiifies volume change as a result of applying X:
#   *If det(x) = 0, then x collapse space completely in at last one dimension, thereby 
#    eliminating all volumes.
#   *If 0<\det(x)\<1, then x contracts volume to some extent.
#   *If \det(x)\ = 1, then x preverves volume exactly.
#   *If \det(x)\>1, then x expands volume.

# *Important -> If any one of the matrix's eigenvalues is 0, then the product of the
# eignevalues must be 0 and the determinant must also be 0.
