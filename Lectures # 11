# In this lecture we will study about the Symmetric and the Identity matrices...
# Symmetric matrix :- 1. shows property of square -> means rows = columns.
#                     2. X ^ Transpose = X -> No change...
# Ok then Let's code...
import numpy as np

x_sym = np.array([[0,1,2],[1,7,8],[2,8,9]])

print("This is the normal x_sym")
print(x_sym)

print("This is an Transposed the x_sym")
x_symT = x_sym.T
print(x_symT) 


# This is just for checking if normal is equal to the transposed one.
print(x_sym == x_symT) # Output -> True

# Identity Matrix :- 1. These are the type of the symmetric matrix.
#                    2. Every element along main dialong is 1.
#                    3. All other elements are 0
idt = np.array([[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]])
ymul = np.array([25, 2, 3])

# Now multiplying the two matrixes..
print(np.dot(idt, ymul)) # It's the same output -> (25, 2, 3)
