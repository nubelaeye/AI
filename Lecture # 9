# In this lecture we are going to see the Dot Product.
# OK let's code it up:-

import numpy as np

# The very first array 
x = np.array([25,2,5])

# The second array
y = np.array([0, 1, 2])

# Print the dot products of the both x and y
print(np.dot(x,y)) # Output -> 12

# The mathematical approach for this problem is : (25 x 0) + (2 x 1) + (5 x 2) = 12
