# By this lecture we will start learning about the Matrix Operations...
# The model of Linear Algebra Applications:
    # 1. Solving for the unknowns in the linear system..
    # 2. Reducing Dimensionalty
    # 3. Ranking result -> with eigenvectors as in google's rank page..
    # 4. Recommenders -> Singular Value decomposition(SVD) for recommending the 
    # most viwed topics. example as youtube as its recommendation for the user just like that.
    # 5. Natural Language processing.. -> SVD, matrix factorization.
        # Used for Topic modeling, Semantic analysis..
# Ok now we are good to go with the Matrix operations...

# Ok then let's start it...
# 1. we will know how to apply matrix.
# Question 1.
import numpy as np

x = np.array([[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]])

u = np.array([2,5,-3])

# This is how we apply the matrix on to the other vector or matrix..
# The word apply means is to multiply.
print(np.dot(x, u))

# Question 2.
b = np.array([[2,0,-1],[-2,3,1],[0,4,-1]])

print(np.dot(b, u))

# Question 3.
u2 = np.array([0,-4,6])
U = u+u2
print(np.dot(U, b))
