# In this lecture we will study about Norms
# Norms:- 
    # When vector represents a magnitude and direction from origins are called Norms.
    # Norms are the functions that quantify vector magnitude.
    # Norms mearsure simple distance from origin.

# Other types of Norms:-
#       1.L^2 Norm
#       2.L^1 Norm
#       3.SquaredL^2 Norm
#       4.Max Norm
# The code for the L^2 norm :-
    # 1. L^2 Norm
import numpy as np

x = np.array([25,2,5])

# Methond 1: By Calculating the L^2 norm by Mathematical represention for only calculating..
print((25**2 + 2**2 + 5**2) ** (1/2)) 
    # In this we have squared the numbers in the array and taken out the (sums) square Root.

# Methond 2: Is by the built in function in the numpy for calculating norms.
print(np.linalg.norm(x))

# There are also the some other types of the norm:-
    
    # 2. L^1 Norm
    # Code for the L^1 norm:-
     
print(np.abs(25)+np.abs(2)+np.abs(5))

    # 3. Squared l^2 Norm -> Used for:- 1.Squared l^2 norm is equal to the x^Transpose^x times,
                                   # 2. Used to train the ML Algorithm 
                                   # 3. Can't used to distguishing between zero and non-zero.
    # Code for the Squared l^2 Norm:-

# Method 1:
print(25**2 + 2**2 + 5**2) # Output -> 654

# Method 2:
print(np.dot(x,x)) # Output -> 654

    # 4. Max Norm Or (L^Infinite Norm):- used for returning the absolute value of the largest magnitude element in the vector.
    # Code for the Max Norm :-

print(np.max([np.abs(25), np.abs(2), np.abs(5)])) # output -> 25, if 26 then 26.
