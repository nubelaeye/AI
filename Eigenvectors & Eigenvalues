# In this lecture we will study about the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues.



# Eigenvectors:- is a special vector v such that when it is transformed by some matrix, the 
# product has the exact same direction as v.

# Eigenvalues:- is a scalar that simply scales the eigenvector v such that the following 
# equation is satisfied : Av = lambda of v.

# Ok, then let's code it up!
import numpy as np 

A = np.array([[-1, 4],[2,-2]])

lambdas, v = np.linalg.eig(A)
# printing the eigenvectors each columns is a separate eigenvector 1, 2 and both have its 
print(v)
# own eigenvalues which is represented here!
# printing the eigenvalues
print(lambdas)

# Checking that the A of v is equal to the Lambda of v.
V = v[:,0]

Lbd = lambdas[0]

Av = np.dot(A,V)
print(Av)
# By these both we know the left hand is equal to the right hand: A * v = lambda * v.
print(Lbd * V)

# Eigenvector in greater than 2 Dimensional!
x = np.array([[25,2,9],[5,26,-5],[3,7,-1]])
lambdaX, V_X = np.linalg.eig(x)

# One eigenvector per column of x..

print(V_X)  
# A corresponding eigenvalues for each eigenvectors..

print(lambdaX)

# X * v = lambda * v
v_x = V_X[:,0]

lambda_x = lambdaX[0]

print(np.dot(x,v_x))

print(v_x * lambda_x)
