# In this Lecture we will see the different types of the vectors:-
# 1. Basis Vector -> Generally used for the unit Vectors -- We have already used it.
# 2. Orthogonal Vector -> x and y are orthogonal vectors if the dot product of those is 0
#                      -> Are 90* to each other
#                      -> Basis Vectors are also Orthogonal vectors

# Code for the Orthogonal Vectors
import numpy as np
i = np.array([1,0])
j = np.array([0,1])

print(np.dot(i,j)) # output -> 0

# 3. Orthonormal Vector -> convert the 2 Orthogonal vectors into unit vectors by dividing them by their magnitudes. 
# So, these vectors will still be orthogonal to each other and now individually they also have unit magnitude. 
# Such vectors are known as Orthonormal vectors. 
# Note: All orthonormal vectors are orthogonal by the definition itself.
